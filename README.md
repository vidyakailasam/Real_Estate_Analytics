# Real_Estate_Analytics
The goals of this project are:
1.A competitor analysis for anyone doing housing code compliance workflows or iBuying.
2.Identify methodologies to reallocate government resources into target communities that affect home values (with low cost of operation and a high discriminatory divergence).
